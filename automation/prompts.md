### üîç Code Quality & Maintainability
| Purpose | Prompt |
|---------|--------|
| **Code Review** | Please provide a comprehensive code review of the code above. Focus on readability, maintainability, performance, and adherence to best practices. Highlight potential bugs, suggest improvements, and provide examples where necessary. |
| **Code Design Pattern Refactor Suggestions** | Analyze this code and suggest appropriate design patterns for refactoring. Explain why each pattern is suitable, how it improves the code, and any potential trade-offs or downsides of applying it. |
| **Break Down Complex Logic into Smaller Functions** | Improve code clarity by breaking down complex logic into smaller, well-defined helper functions. Make sure the output you give is a working version and not just an illustrative example. |
| **Force Code Outputs to be Functional** | I need a complete and functional code implementation, not just a conceptual or illustrative example. The code should be executable and include all necessary components to work as intended. |
| **Refactor for DRY Principles** | Review the codebase and identify areas where the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is violated. Refactor to reduce duplication. |
| **Suggest Consistent Naming Conventions** | Review variable, function, and class names. Recommend naming conventions that enhance readability and consistency. |
| **Improve Inline Documentation** | Review the code for comments and docstrings. Suggest improvements or generate them if missing. |
| **Modularization Recommendations** | Recommend how to break this monolithic codebase into more modular, reusable components or services. |

### üöÄ Performance & Scalability
| Purpose | Prompt |
|---------|--------|
| **Performance Bottleneck Analysis** | Analyze the code for potential performance bottlenecks. Recommend optimizations and provide before-and-after examples when possible. |
| **Memory and Resource Optimization** | Are there opportunities in this codebase to reduce memory usage or improve resource management? Suggest concrete changes. |
| **Scalability Assessment** | Is this codebase scalable? If not, suggest architectural or structural changes that would support scale. |
| **Evaluate Caching Opportunities** | Are there parts of this codebase where caching could significantly improve performance? Suggest caching strategies or libraries. |

### üß™ Testing & Validation
| Purpose | Prompt |
|---------|--------|
| **Testability Review** | Assess how easy this code is to test. Suggest improvements to increase testability, such as dependency injection or modularization. |
| **Generate Unit Tests** | Generate a complete suite of unit tests for the code, using appropriate frameworks and mocking libraries. Include assertions and edge cases. |
| **Edge Case Identification** | Identify possible edge cases that this codebase may not currently handle. Recommend improvements. |

---

### üîê Security & Risk
| Purpose | Prompt |
|---------|--------|
| **Security Vulnerability Review** | Analyze this code for potential security risks or vulnerabilities. Suggest mitigations or safer coding practices. |
| **Injection & Input Validation Check** | Review the code for input validation, sanitization, and protections against injection attacks (SQL, command, etc.). Recommend best practices. |

---

### üß± Architecture & Dependencies
| Purpose | Prompt |
|---------|--------|
| **Dependency Health Check** | Review the codebase‚Äôs dependencies for outdated, insecure, or bloated packages. Suggest actions for improving dependency hygiene. |
| **Reduce Technical Debt** | How can I reduce technical debt for this codebase? Provide specific, actionable recommendations, such as refactoring strategies, testing improvements, dependency management, documentation enhancements, and architectural adjustments. |
| **Production Readiness Check** | Is this codebase production-ready? Evaluate the code for stability, scalability, performance, security, and completeness. Suggest any changes required to meet production standards. |

---

### üìÑ Documentation & Developer Experience
| Purpose | Prompt |
|---------|--------|
| **New Developer Onboarding Doc** | As a newly onboarded **software developer joining this project**, write a comprehensive onboarding document that would help someone in your position deeply understand the codebase. The document should walk through the overall structure, core modules, key workflows, architectural decisions, and any domain-specific knowledge required. Include relevant code snippets to illustrate important concepts, patterns, or entry points. Assume the reader is technical but unfamiliar with this specific codebase, and focus on making the learning curve as smooth and complete as possible. |
| **README.md generation** | Generate a README.md file for this code that includes an overview of the application, describing its purpose and functionality, along with a description of the key files and their roles within the project. Do not include contributing guidelines or license information. |
| **Generate CONTRIBUTING.md** | Generate a CONTRIBUTING.md file with guidelines on how to contribute to this codebase (branch naming, PR process, code style, etc.). |
| **Environment Setup Instructions** | Create a step-by-step guide for setting up the development environment from scratch. |

### üß† System Prompt: Flask Best Practices to Follow

When working with Flask, follow these foundational best practices to ensure scalability, maintainability, and clean architecture from the beginning:

- **Use Flask-Celery** immediately instead of relying on threads for background tasks. This ensures proper task management, reliability, and async scalability.
- **Separate CSS and JS** into static files right away. Avoid inline styles or scripts to maintain cleaner templates and enable better caching and reuse.
- **Adopt Flask-SQLAlchemy and Flask-Migrate** from the start for database modeling and migrations. This ensures consistent schema management and easier collaboration.
- **Keep the project modular** using Flask blueprints. Group blueprints into separate folders by domain to improve code organization and scalability.
- **Use centralized error handling** via a structured system of:
  - Predefined **custom exception classes** (e.g., `AppError`, `NotFoundError`, `ValidationError`, etc.) located in a shared `exceptions.py` module.
  - Global **Flask error handlers** registered using `@app.errorhandler()` decorators, which return standardized JSON responses with appropriate HTTP status codes.
  - All unhandled exceptions must return a 500 Internal Server Error with a generic message, while being fully logged (stack trace included) using the **Python `logging` module**, configured app-wide in `logging_config.py`.
  - No inline `try/except` unless absolutely necessary for localized flow control ‚Äî error handling must propagate to the centralized system.
  - Every error response must follow a consistent schema: `{ "error": "Message", "code": 400 }`.

These practices should be assumed as defaults when building or reviewing any Flask-based application.
